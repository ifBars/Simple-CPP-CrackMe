# Simple-CPP-CrackMe

A beginner-friendly CrackMe implemented in C++ for those interested in learning reverse engineering and decompiling. This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience for individuals looking to explore the bare minimum basics of binary analysis.

## Overview

This CrackMe (Crack Me If You Can) is a simple console application that challenges users to find the correct password through decompiling. It serves as a practical introduction to the concepts of reverse engineering, debugging, and decompiling.

## Features

- **Password Challenge:** Users are prompted to input a password.
- **Feedback:** The program provides feedback on whether the entered password is correct.
- **String concatenation:** Incorporates a simple string concatenation technique to add an extra layer of challenge.

## Usage

1. Download source code

2. Compile source code into exe

3. Decompile exe using your decompiler of choice (ie. IDA, x32Dbg/x64Dbg, etc), and use binary patching to get the program to either, think you put in the right password when you did not, or, plain out give you the correct password if you type in an incorrect one. Of course, you could always try both for an added challenge!
